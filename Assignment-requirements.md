# Interview Assignment: Build an Agentic

# Software Engineering System- URL Shortener

## 1. Objective

Build a working prototype that transforms a requirement into a reviewable engineering
outcome using an agentic execution model. Demonstrate requirement understanding, task
decomposition, multi-step execution, and output generation/validation. Focus on end-to-
end SDLC automation with controlled autonomy.

## 2. Scenario

You will build a URL shortener service from scratch with core APIs, analytics, and reliability
features.
Your task is to complete and improve it over 2-3 days using AI assistance
(Copilot/Claude/etc.) while demonstrating engineering judgment.

## 3. Scope

 Greenfield scenarios (new systems/features)
 Brownfield scenarios (enhancements, refactors, bug fixes)
 Test and documentation improvements
 Well-defined and ambiguous requirements

## 4. Core Requirements

1) Requirement Understanding: Interpret intent, identify ambiguity, normalize into a clear
engineering problem.

2) Task Decomposition: Convert high-level requirements into actionable tasks with
dependencies and sequencing.

3) Codebase Reasoning (Brownfield): Identify impacted modules/services/APIs/data flows
and demonstrate architectural understanding.

4) Workflow Orchestration (Critical Differentiator): Design and implement an agentic
orchestration layer that coordinates the full SDLC lifecycle across requirements,
architecture/design, implementation, testing, documentation, release readiness, and
demonstrates non-linear, stateful execution with governance rather than simple linear task
chaining. The orchestration must use an explicit dependency graph with entry/exit gates,


support sequential and parallel paths with synchronization, preserve cross-stage context
and decision lineage, enforce human approval checkpoints for high-impact actions, and
include bounded retries, fallback, rollback, and safe-stop controls. It must also embed policy
guardrails for security, compliance, and change control, provide audit-grade observability
and traceability, track reliability metrics such as success rate, retry/rollback frequency,
MTTR, and end-to-end latency, and dynamically re-plan when upstream outputs change
while maintaining governance and controlled agent autonomy.

5) Engineering Output Generation: Produce production-quality code, API/schema
definitions, unit/integration tests, and supporting documentation with clean design and
maintainability.

6) Validation and Risk Control: Identify risks/trade-offs/failure scenarios and define
validation and safety guardrails.

7) Controlled Autonomy: Agents execute multi-step work; humans provide oversight,
approvals, and final quality control.

8) Final Engineering Summary: Include plan/rationale, artifacts, risks/trade-offs/validation,
assumptions, and limitations.

## 5. Deliverables

 Working prototype (runnable end-to-end)
 Architecture overview (components, orchestration model, control flow, key decisions)
 Three scenarios: greenfield, brownfield, ambiguous (each shows decomposition,
orchestration, validation)
 Setup instructions
 Testing approach, limitations, and trade-offs

## 6. Evaluation Criteria

 Effectiveness of agentic orchestration
 Architecture/system design quality
 Depth of decomposition and execution quality
 Realism/quality of outputs
 Validation and risk management rigor
 Clarity and defensibility of decisions
 Core engineering principles: modular, testable, reliable, secure, scalable code with safe
change management
 Engineering judgment


## 7. Expectation

Treat as production-grade engineering work. Demonstrate strong design fundamentals,
lifecycle orchestration capability, output ownership, and defensible reasoning. Principle:
Agents execute under defined autonomy boundaries; humans own oversight, approvals, and
final quality.
